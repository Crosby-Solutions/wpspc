# School Banking Program

School Banking Day for WPS is Friday morning between 8.30am and 8.40am. You can join the program by opening or having an existing CommBank Youthsaver account. Your child will receive a Dollarmites deposit wallet to use for school banking. Every deposit collects a silver Dollarmites token, once you collect 10 tokens you can choose a reward. You can also track savings progress in the CommBank Youth app.
If you have any questions on our school banking program please contact Candace Higgs, P&C President on 0433 165 664 or via our email address willettonprimarypandc@gmail.com
