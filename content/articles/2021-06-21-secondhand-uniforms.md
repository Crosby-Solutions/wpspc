If you have old, outgrown uniforms and donâ€™t know what to do with them then donate them to the P&C! A blue bin is located in the assembly area of the school, Julie collects these pre-loved uniforms which can be purchased for a $2 donation to the P&C. Julie can be contacted via the P&C email or via our Facebook account.
